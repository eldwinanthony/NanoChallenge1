    Content(motivation: "One must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness.", gratefulness: "Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things."),
    Content(motivation: "We must understand that sadness is an ocean, and sometimes we drown, while other days we are forced to swim.", gratefulness: "Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some."),
    Content(motivation: "Experiencing sadness and anger can make you feel more creative, and by being creative you can get beyond your pain or negativity.", gratefulness: "If you want to turn your life around, try thankfulness. It will change your life mightily."),
    Content(motivation: "Some days are just bad days, that’s all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that’s just the way it is!", gratefulness: "Gratitude turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos into order, confusion into clarity. It makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow."),
    Content(motivation: "You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.", gratefulness: "Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough."),
    Content(motivation: "The good life is not one immune to sadness but one in which suffering contributes to our development.", gratefulness: "Let us rise up and be thankful, for if we didn't learn a lot today, at least we learned a little, and if we didn't learn a little, at least we didn't get sick, and if we got sick, at least we didn't die; so, let us all be thankful."),
    Content(motivation: "What brings us to tears, will lead us to grace. Our pain is never wasted.", gratefulness: "Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. Gratitude is the completion of thankfulness. Thankfulness may consist merely of words. Gratitude is shown in acts."),
    Content(motivation: "We will always have seasons of struggles and testing. There are times when everything we attempt to do will seem to go wrong.", gratefulness: "When You started counting your blessings, your whole life turned around."),
    Content(motivation: "To each of us some rain must fall because life is not always cast in a play that has the script you expect or want.", gratefulness: "Gratitude also opens your eyes to the limitless potential of the universe, while dissatisfaction closes your eyes to it."),
    Content(motivation: "There are beautiful things in the world and there are sad things and when they come together they make a star", gratefulness: "In life, one has a choice to take one of two paths: to wait for some special day or to celebrate each special day.")
